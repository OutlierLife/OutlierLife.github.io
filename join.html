<h2>
So How Should You Go About Starting Your Self Improvement?</h2>
<p>
Before We Begin I want to mention this one single principle that will help your grasp the point of self-improvement which is Instant and Delayed gratification. You may have heard of instant gratification and delayed gratification.
Most people overindulge in instant gratification activities like video games, social media, watching tv, and eating junk food. Instant gratification is all the activities that give you comfort and pleasure now but after indulging in them that make your life worse. And this becomes the only source of pleasure for the average person. Why do you think people nowadays are filled with regret? Regret is simply something that your younger self did that put you in some sort of negative situation. People will eat junk food and once the taste is gone from their mouths they regret it later. Most teenagers play video games for hours and regret it when they procrastinate on the assessment that was coming up. 
</p>
<p>
But the opposite is delayed gratification. It is when you delay the pleasure for your future self. It is doing something that is uncomfortable now but will make you live better in the future. It is pushing yourself on that set of curls so your future self can have bigger biceps. It is studying so that your future self can get a good grade. Eating healthy now so that your future self can look good and be healthy. 
</p>
<p>
The average person heavily overindulges in instant gratification activities. But if you are watching this you don’t want to end up like the average person.
Look I am not saying to cut out all instant gratification in your life. But start to decrease the instant gratification and increase the delayed gratification in your life. 
When you start delaying gratification. You start to feel so good about yourself, you feel more confident, and you have better self-esteem.
Start introducing delayed gratification activities like meditating, working out, journaling, and reading.
</p>
<p>
Meditate now so you can become more present.
</p>
<p>
Experience the discomfort of working out now so that your future self can have an aesthetic and strong body.
</p>
<p>
Journal now so that your future self can have more charity.
</p>
<p>
Read now so your future self can be wiser
</p>
<p>
So in order to minimize instant gratification and maximize delayed gratification you must first change your habits. Changing your habits can seem difficult and frustrating but it doesn't have to be if you adopt the following tips.
</p>
<h1>
Tips to Develop Bulletproof Habits
</h1>
<p>
Make it easy: Make it as easy as possible to perform the desired behavior. For example, if you want to start exercising regularly, choose a workout routine that is convenient and fits easily into your schedule.
</p>

<p>


Start small: Begin with small, achievable goals and gradually build up to larger ones. This can help you avoid becoming overwhelmed and increase your chances of success.
</p>


<p>


Use triggers: Associate your desired behavior with a specific cue, or trigger, that you encounter on a regular basis. For example, you might brush your teeth every morning as a cue to take your vitamins.
</p>

<p>


Seek accountability: Find someone to hold you accountable for your actions, such as a friend or coach. This can help you stay motivated and on track. Accountability is incredibly powerful so use it to your advantage.
</p>

<p>


Monitor your progress: Keep track of your progress through a habit tracker or journal, and celebrate your successes along the way.
</p>

<p>


Make it rewarding: Find ways to reward yourself for performing the desired behavior. This can help you build positive associations and increase your motivation.
</p>

<p>
Plan for setbacks: Don't be discouraged if you slip up or encounter obstacles along the way. Instead, plan for setbacks and have strategies in place to help you get back on track. Setbacks are going to be inevitable on your self-improvement journey but they will only help you grow. Your whole life you have been fed the lie that failure is such a bad thing. That it should be avoided at all costs. From School, From the media that only show the success stories like failure is nonexistent, from the people around you. 
But every time you fail you get closer to success. Every failure is like one dig with a shovel that will get you closer to the gold. Keep keep failing and You will strike gold.


It is impossible to live without failing at something, unless
you live so cautiously that you might as well not have lived at
all, in which case you have failed by default. </p>
</p>
<p>
If you aren't failing you simply are not going to become successful. When has someone gone digging for gold and the gold is simply lying there on the ground without them even digging for it? Never. You have to keep digging for days, weeks, months, and years until one day you reach the success you find the gold. 
You need to fail more. If you don't fail you have simply haven't attempted anything because you live so cautiously that you might as well not have lived at all.
</p>
<p>
You know how many times I failed to lose weight. 
</p>


<p>

How many times I failed to improve my habits
</p>
<p>

How many times I failed trying to be productive
</p>
<p>
How many times I failed trying to meditate
</p>
<p>

How many times I failed a PR in a workout
</p>
<p>
You have to be willing to fail and be accountable for it.

You have to be willing to admit failure to yourself but be willing to try again and again and again until you succeed.

Each failure will get you one step closer to success.
